# Tasks
Please complete the following tasks and post them on the tapaScript Discord under "40 Days of JavaScript".

> **DO NOT USE AI to FIND ANSWERS**. If you are stuck, let's discuss it on DISCORD and learn. Also, please note that none of the answers need you to create any UI. Just focus on the logic building and print the output on the browser console.

## 1. What will be the output of the following code and why?
```js
function outer() {
    let count = 0;
    return function inner() {
        count++;
        console.log(count);
    };
}
const counter = outer();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
// Every time counter() executes runs inner() as return value and make count increse.
// log the count and value stored on memory and next time count and to be initialized then increse count from its' previous value stored in memory
```

## 2. What will be the output and why?
```js
function testClosure() {
    let x = 10;
    return function () {
        return x * x;
    };
}
console.log(testClosure()());  // 100
// Same answer from above but this time return function is not stored as variable instead of anonymous func . so testClosure() & () excute it prints value and get from closure.
```

## 3. Create a button dynamically and attach a click event handler using a closure. The handler should count and log how many times the button was clicked.

```js
function clickMe() {
  let count = 0;

  document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", () => {
    count++;
    console.log(`You Cilcked ${count} time(s)`);
  });
}
clickMe();
```

## 4. Write a function `createMultiplier(multiplier)` that returns another function to multiply numbers.

## 5. What happens if a closure references an object?
- 1) The object is garbage collected immediately
- 2) The object remains in memory as long as the closure exists  
- 3) The object is automatically cloned
- 4) None of the Above.

// Ansewr : - 2. The object remains in memory as long as the closure exists 

## 6. Write a function factory of counter to increment, decrement, and reset a counter. Use closure to refer the count value across the functuions.

```js 
function Factory(number) {
  let count = number;

  return {
    "increment" : () => {
      count++;
      console.log(count);
    },
    "decrement" : () => {
      count--;
      console.log(count);
    },
    "reset" : () => {
      count = 0;
    }
  }
}
let action = Factory(8);
action.decrement();
action.decrement();
action.decrement();
action.increment();
action.increment();
action.increment();
action.increment();
action.decrement();
action.reset()
action.decrement();
```
