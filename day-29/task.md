# Tasks

Please complete the following tasks and post them on the tapaScript Discord under "40 Days of JavaScript".

> **DO NOT USE AI to FIND ANSWERS**. If you are stuck, let's discuss it on DISCORD and learn. Also, please note that none of the answers need you to create any UI. Just focus on the logic building and print the output on the browser console.

## 1. Identify Real-Life Objects with OOP Concepts

Pick any 3 real-life objects (e.g., smartphone, bicycle, school), and for each:

- List at least 3 properties (attributes).
- List at least 3 behaviors (methods).
- Write which OOP principle each property or behavior best represents and why.

<!-- smartphone:

- screen, battery, button
- interacting(), charging(), powerOnOrOff()
-   screen - encapsultion click make a call but doesn't know how works internally
    charging - abstraction , make mobile works to know but not how they works
    button - abstraction

bicycle:

- wheel, handle, chain 
 - movement(), control(), makeMoveWheel()
 -  wheel - abstraction, nothing to protect but make move cycle
    handleBar - abstraction, is all visable control when rotate to right left goes that direction
    chain - abstraction

school: 

- student, class, teachers
- study(), haveStudentTeacher(), teachStudents()
-   student - inheritence from person, but study
    classRoom - polymorphism - bcoz makes student sit and study and teacher to tech to them 
    teacher - inheritence from person, teach students -->


## 2. Draw a Diagram of an OOP Modeled System

Create a diagram (hand-drawn or digital) of a system like:

- A library system (Books, Members, Staff, etc.)
- Or a fast-food restaurant system (Orders, Menus, Employee)
In the diagram Show classes/objects

- Arrows to represent relationships like inheritance or composition
- Indicate which class encapsulates what data and methods

## 3. Explain OOP Principles with Human Analogies

 Write your own analogy (non-code) to explain each of the 5 OOP principles:

- Abstraction
    => if want to make the process easy hide complexity, show what they need
- Encapsulation
    => if want make unaccessable, restrict to public usage 
- Inheritance
    => import from parent class get the methods, properties
- Polymorphism
    => get from parent but use it in own use cases, 
- Composition
    => get from parents but not make whole thing, its a feature to that

It must be unique (not from the class), and explain how that analogy relates to programming.

## 4. Compare OOP vs Functional Thinking

Choose a simple system (e.g., a To-Do app or Alarm Clock) and:

- Describe how you’d design it using OOP (with objects)
- Describe how you’d design it using Functional Programming (with functions)

You don’t have to write code — just use words and bullets.

<!-- 
Alarm Clock:

get timer from local device, calculate it with some function
only display current time
while setting timer add with current do some calculate in behind
show confirmation alarm is setted

- getCuurent(Date.time())
- displayTime()
- setTimer() {
    currentTime() + timer() = vaule
}
displayAlram()
makeAlram()
 -->

## 5. Object vs Class vs Function – Explain Like a Teacher

Imagine you’re teaching a 10-year-old:

- What is a Class?
- What is an Object?
- What is a Function?

<!-- Class => is a blueprint if person is class we can create differ types of person from that
Object => is a person have some same or differ charactertics, behaviour 
Function or methods => make the object do something, chage to something with use cases -->

Use simple language, drawings, or emojis if needed.
